📝 Task: Build a Mini Group Chat with Socket.IO
🎯 Goal

Create a chat app where:

Multiple users can connect.

Users can join specific group chats (rooms).

Messages are delivered only to people in the same group.

🔹 Step 1: Setup

Create a small Node.js + Express server.

Install socket.io.

Create a simple HTML frontend with an input box + join room button + chat area.

🔹 Step 2: Connect Users

On client load → establish socket connection.

Display the socket.id on screen so you know each user is unique.

🔹 Step 3: Join Group Chat (Room)

Add a text box where user can enter a room name (e.g., groupA, groupB).

When they click “Join”, emit joinRoom.

On server, socket.join(room) to add them to that room.

🔹 Step 4: Messaging Inside Group

Add an input box for sending messages.

When user types a message → emit chatMessage with { room, text }.

Server should broadcast it with io.to(room).emit("chatMessage", ...).

🔹 Step 5: Test with Multiple Tabs

Open two or more browser tabs.

Make User A join groupA, User B join groupA, User C join groupB.

Send messages and confirm:

A ↔ B can chat together (since both in groupA).

C sees only groupB messages.

✅ Deliverable for yourself:

A working mini web app where you can test group chat by opening multiple tabs.

Bonus: add UI to show which users are inside the same room.
